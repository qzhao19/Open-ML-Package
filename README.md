# tiny-OpenML (ing...)
The tiny-openml is an open-source machine learning library, it aims to provide fast, simple machine learning tools for data analysis. 


# Overview
In recent years, based on features like simplicity, efficiency, and accessibility to users, scikit-learn has become the most widely used machine learning library. However, being restricted to the performance of programming language, it is not suitable for large-scale machine-learning tasks. This project aims to provide machine learning amateurs with fast and simple tools. Meanwhile, these implementations of typical machine learning algorithms are free to share with anyone.

In order to provide efficient implementations, the core algorithms of open-ml-package is written in C++ language. 


# Dependencies
