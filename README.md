# Open-ML-Package (ing...)
The open-ml-package is an open-source machine learning library, it aims to provide fast, simple machine learning tools for data analysis. 


# Overview
In the recent years, on the basis of features like simple, efficient and accessible to users, scikit-learn has become the most widely used machine learning library. However, being restricted to the performance of programming language, it is not suitable for large-scale machine learning tasks. This project aims to provide machine learning amateur with a fast and simple tools. Meanwhile, these implementations of typical machine learning algorithms is free to share for anyone.

In order to provide efficient implementations, the core algorithms of open-ml-package is written in C++ language.
